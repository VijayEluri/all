<h1 id="1" class="title">Gun N&#8217; Roses</h1><div id="div1"></div><h2 id="2" class="title">Civil War</h2><div id="div2"><p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve got here is failure to communicate.<br />
Some men you just can&#8217;t reach&#8230;<br />
So, you get what we had here last week<br />
Which is the way he wants it!<br />
Well, he gets it!<br />
N&#8217; I don&#8217;t like it any more than you men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at your young men fighting<br />
Look at your women crying<br />
Look at your young men dying<br />
The way they&#8217;ve always done before</p>
<p>Look at the hate we&#8217;re breeding<br />
Look at the fear we&#8217;re feeding<br />
Look at the lives we&#8217;re leading<br />
The way we&#8217;ve always done before</p>
<p>My hands are tied<br />
The billions shift from side to side<br />
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride<br />
For the love of God and our human rights<br />
And all these things are swept aside<br />
By bloody hands time can&#8217;t deny<br />
And are washed away by your genocide<br />
And history hides the lies of our civil wars</p>
<p>D&#8217;you wear a black armband<br />
When they shot the man<br />
Who said &#8220;Peace could last forever&#8221;</p>
<p>And in my first memories<br />
They shot Kennedy<br />
An I went numb when I learned to see</p>
<p>So I never fell for Vietnam<br />
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all<br />
That you can&#8217;t trust freedom<br />
when it&#8217;s not in your hands<br />
When everybody&#8217;s fightin&#8217;<br />
for their promised land</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need your civil war<br />
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor<br />
Your power hungry sellin&#8217; soldiers<br />
In a human grocery store<br />
Ain&#8217;t that fresh<br />
I don&#8217;t need your civil war</p>
<p>Look at the shoes you&#8217;re filling<br />
Look at the blood we&#8217;re spilling<br />
Look at the world we&#8217;re killing<br />
The way we&#8217;ve always done before</p>
<p>Look in the doubt we&#8217;ve wallowed<br />
Look at the leaders we&#8217;ve followed<br />
Look at the lies we&#8217;ve swallowed<br />
And I don&#8217;t want to hear no more</p>
<p>My hands are tied<br />
For all I&#8217;ve seen has changed my mind<br />
But still the wars go on as the years go by<br />
With no love of God or human rights<br />
&#8217;Cause all these dreams are swept aside<br />
By bloody hands of the hypnotized<br />
Who carry the cross of homicide<br />
And history bears the scars of our civil wars</p>
<p>&#8220;We practice selective annihilation of mayors<br />
and government officials<br />
for example to create a vacuum<br />
Then we fill that vacuum<br />
as popular war advances.<br />
Peace is closer&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need your civil war<br />
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor<br />
Your power hungry sellin&#8217; soldiers<br />
In a human grocery store<br />
Ain&#8217;t that fresh<br />
I don&#8217;t need your civil war<br />
I don&#8217;t need your civil war<br />
Your power hungry sellin&#8217; soldiers<br />
In a human grocery store<br />
Ain&#8217;t that fresh<br />
I don&#8217;t need your civil war<br />
I don&#8217;t need one more war<br />
I don&#8217;t need one more war<br />
Whaz so civil &#8217;bout war anyway</p>
</div><h2 id="3" class="title">Don&#8217;t Cry</h2><div id="div3"><p>Talk to me softly<br />

</div><h2 id="4" class="title">Yesterdays</h2><div id="div4"><p>Yesterday, there was so many things<br />
I was never told<br />
Now that I&#8217;m startin&#8217; to learn<br />
I feel I&#8217;m growing old</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause yesterday&#8217;s got nothin&#8217; for me<br />
Old pictures that I&#8217;ll always see<br />
Time just fades the pages<br />
In my book of memories<br />
Prayers in my pocket<br />
And no hand in destiny<br />
I&#8217;ll keep on movin&#8217; along<br />
With no time to plant my feet</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause yesterday&#8217;s got nothin&#8217; for me<br />
Old pictures that I&#8217;ll always see<br />
Some things could be better<br />
If we&#8217;d all just let them be</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s got nothin&#8217; for me<br />
Yesterday&#8217;s got nothin&#8217; for me<br />
Got nothin&#8217; for me</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was so many things<br />
I was never shown<br />
Suddenly this time I found<br />
I&#8217;m on the streets and I&#8217;m all alone</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s got nothin&#8217; for me<br />
Old pictures that I&#8217;ll always see<br />
I ain&#8217;t got time to reminisce old novelties</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s got nothin&#8217; for me<br />
Yesterday&#8217;s got nothin&#8217; for me<br />
Yesterday&#8217;s got nothin&#8217; for me<br />
Yesterday</p>

See the thorn twist in your side<br />
I wait for you</p>
<p>Sleight of hand and twist of fate<br />
On a bed of nails she makes me wait<br />
And I wait without you</p>
<p>With or without you<br />
With or without you</p>
<p>Through the storm we reach the shore<br />
You give it all but I want more<br />
And Im waiting for you</p>
<p>With or without you<br />
With or without you<br />
I cant live<br />
With or without you</p>
<p>And you give yourself away<br />
And you give yourself away<br />
And you give<br />
And you give<br />
And you give yourself away</p>
<p>My hands are tied<br />
My body bruised, shes got me with<br />
Nothing to win and<br />
Nothing left to lose</p>
<p>And you give yourself away<br />
And you give yourself away<br />
And you give<br />
And you give<br />
And you give yourself away</p>
<p>With or without you<br />
With or without you<br />

Or altogether just taken apart<br />
We&#8217;re reeling through an endless fall<br />
We are the ever-living ghost of what once was</p>
<p>But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do<br />
No one&#8217;s gonna love you more than I do</p>
<p>And anything to make you smile<br />
It is my better side of you to admire<br />
But they should never take so long<br />
Just to be over then back to another one</p>
<p>But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do<br />
No one&#8217;s gonna love you more than I do</p>
<p>But someone,<br />
They could have warned you<br />
When things start splitting at the seams and now<br />
The whole thing&#8217;s tumbling down<br />
Things start splitting at the seams and now<br />
If things start splitting at the seams and now,<br />
It&#8217;s tumbling down<br />
Hard.</p>
<p>Anything to make you smile<br />
You are the ever-living ghost of what once was<br />
I never want to hear you say<br />
That you&#8217;d be better off<br />
Or you liked it that way</p>
<p>But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do<br />
No one&#8217;s gonna love you more than I do</p>

They should have warned you<br />

Things start splitting at the seams and now<br />

trembling and getting old<br />
smelling burnt oil of heaven<br />
about ten years, too big to hold</p>
<p>she don&#8217;t get up when I come into the room<br />
she don&#8217;t run through the fields anymore</p>
<p>built a fire in the kitchen<br />
made her bed by a stove<br />
took a walk to the graveyard<br />
but she didn&#8217;t want to go</p>
<p>she don&#8217;t worry all them murders of crows<br />
even though they was always out of reach</p>

Lived with you</p>

Everybody say<br />
To do each an every little thing<br />
But what does it bring<br />
If i ain&#8217;t got you, ain&#8217;t got you</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like, baby<br />
You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like<br />
To love somebody<br />
To love somebody<br />
The way i love you</p>
<p>In my brain<br />
I see your face again<br />
I know my frame of mind<br />
You ain&#8217;t got to be so blind<br />
I&#8217;m blind, so so so blind<br />
I&#8217;m a man, can&#8217;t you see<br />
