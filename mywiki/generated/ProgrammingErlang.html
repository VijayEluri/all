<h1 id="1" class="title">Getting Started</h1><div id="div1"><p>All variable names must start with an uppercase letter, they are called single assignment variables. = is a pattern matching operator</p>
<p><strong>Lhs = Rhs</strong> really means this:<br />
evaluate the right side (Rhs), and then match the result against the pattern on the left side (Lhs).</p>
<p>How can you express something like X = X + 1 in Erlang? The answer is easy. Invent a new variable whose name hasn’t been used before (say X1), and write X1 = X + 1.</p>
<p>Atoms start with lowercase letters, followed by a sequence of alphanumeric characters or the underscore (_) or at (@) sign. Atoms can also be quoted with a single quotation mark (’). Using the quoted form, we can create atoms that start with uppercase letters or that contain non-alphanumeric characters.</p>
<p>Tuples are similar to structs in C, with the difference that they are anonymous. To make it easier to remember what a tuple is being used for, it’s common to use an atom as the first element of the tuple, which describes what the tuple represents. So we’d write {point, 10, 45} instead of {10, 45}, which makes the program a lot more understandable.</p>
<p>The symbol _ is called an anonymous variable. Unlike regular variables, several occurrences of _ in the same pattern don’t have to bind to the same value.</p>
<p>We create a list by enclosing the list elements in square brackets and separating them with commas.</p>
<p>If T is a list, then <a href="T.html">H</a> is also a list,11 with head H and tail T. The vertical bar | separates the head of a list from its tail. &quot;&quot;:.html is the empty list.</p>
<p>Strings are really just lists of integers. In Erlang, you must use double quotes. We don’t need to know which integer represents a particular character.  We can use the &#8217;&#8217;&#8217;“dollar syntax”&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; for this purpose. So, for example, $a is actually the integer that represents the character a, and so on.</p>
